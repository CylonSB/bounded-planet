Vague ideas no one knows how to execute. Maybe a common vague notion that people keep coming up with but then never gets fully expanded. Acts as a “bounty board” for people to attempt to brainstorm/prototype these ideas and promote them to other categories.

## Truly persistent single-shard world
Game enables a large single-shard indefinitely persistent world.
For example: Eve, Star base.

## Feudal player relations
Player alliances are not simple "all the same color", but more of patch work of individuals agreed to work together.

## Data Link 
"What if we had a data link network that you use screeps to fight over as a second layer of the game"

## Gameplay Accessibility
Systems are easy to understand and consequences of actions are obvious.
The game should be accessible to a broad range of skillsets, and playable in a broad range of ways.
Highly complex systems are not required to be competitive.
Complex systems aren't the deciding factor in direct interactions.
You don't lose player agency, even if your opponent has dived deeply into complex systems. < - Nyef's vote for definition

Players can focus their gameplay in specific goals/roles. For example, miners/truckers in space games.

## Player Generalisation
Not specialisation.

## Tower defence-like gameplay
Gameplay based around constructing walls/turrets/etc to defend
