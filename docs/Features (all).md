## Streaming Economy
The player does not need to save up enough resources to build something before starting to build it.
 - Supcom-alike economy. Economy is based more on _flow_ of resources than resource stockpile itself.
 - Resources can be spent as they are accumulated (without waiting for the full required amount).
 - Planetary Annihilation is an actual example rather than another definition.

## Biomes
Sections of map have significantly different features that change gameplay.
 - e.g. deserts do not allow tanks to pass, swamps do not allow any ground troops.
 - Minecraft...? Biomes don't have to have major gameplay consequences per se, can just be flavour
 - Terraria
 - Starbound

## AI Rules Of Engagement
AI units can have rules that change what actions they take.
 - e.g. set these specific units to attack anyone (even allies) who enters this user defined area
 - can specify range, which player, and possibly more complex interactions for how the AI functions in relation to others 
 - Arma 3 rules of engagement maybe something to look at

## Supply Chains
Multiple resources must be combined to produce new resources.
 - e.g. Coal+Iron=>Steel
 - Such as modded Minecraft (FtB), Anno games, etc
 - e.g. exempli.g. e.gratia factorio
 - exempli gratia 

## Multiple Production Chains
There are multiple different supply chains/buildings that can be used to produce the same thing.
 - Iron+Coal=>2 Steel, Iron+Wood=>1 Steel
 - Alternative routes to produce resources, so players could theoretically bypass more complicated mechanics for an efficiency loss
 - factorio
 - Dwarf Fortress
 - Cataclysm DDA

## Hand Built Factories
Player can hand build complex production chains to produce items, like Factorio.
 - e.g. Factorio
 - shapez.io
 - CoaDE-level depth to creating individual motors used in robotic arms for moving and transporting items within a single factory tile
   (**we dont want this btw**)

## Logistic Factories
Players put down factories in single bases without having to worry about the details of exactly where they are and how resources move.
 - e.g. build vans and roads in a factory to automatically move stuff between buildings.

## Victory Obelisks
Several incredibly expensive structures must be built by a player/team to win the game.
 - e.g. AOE Wonders Victory

## Adjacency Bonus
Factories next to other factories get a built in production bonus.
 - e.g. Supcom
 - e.g. Offworld Trading Company

## Mining Resources
Resources are extracted from the world.
 - e.g. Supcom/Planetary Annihilation (mass spots)
 - e.g. wood is gathered from forests, which disappear (e.g. AOE)

## Mines Get Worse
Resource node extracted resources get less over time/amount of extracted resources.
 - e.g. over 24 hours of being exploited the mine output goes from 10 iron/s to 1 iron/s
 - e.g. a forest disappears when you cut it down

## Mines Get Better
Resource node extracted resources get more over time/amount of extracted/with investment resources.
 - e.g. over 24 hours of a mine being exploited output goes from 1 iron/s to 10 iron/s
 - e.g. 1000 iron can be spent to double the output of a mining output

## Static Logistics Routes (Roads/Rails)
Paths for ground units can be defined and laid out in the world, following defined and static routes.
 - e.g. Roads take a small amount of time and resources to build. But can only carry a small truck.
 - e.g. Train tracks take a large amount of time and resources to build. But can carry huge train loads of resources.

## Free Logistics Routes
Units can move stuff without a predefined static path per route.
 - e.g. Trucks that can traverse the world without a road. But slowly.

## Neutral Infrastructure
Certain physical infrastructure (roads, railways, resource miners, warehouses, airstrips etc) can be used by anyone.

## Directly Player Owned Infrastructure
Certain physical infrastructure can an only used by a specific "owner".

## Indirectly Player Owned Infrastructure
Players can only "own"/"control" a node by defending it.

## Resource Nodes Can Be Claimed
Claiming may be through building on an otherwise neutral site (like building a mine on a node).

## Building/etc. Capturability
Certain units are capable of capturing buildings/etc to your side.

## Infantry
Low level barely-combat-capable units that can capture or anti-capture stuff.

## Required Upkeep
Armies _require_ resources.
 - e.g. a tank without fuel takes damage over time.
 - e.g. a tank without fuel takes no action.

## Optional Upkeep
Armies with upkeep requirements not met are less effective.
 - e.g. a tank without fuel can't move as fast.
 - e.g. a tank without fuel moves slower/fires slower.

## Shared Unit Resource Pools
An entire army/group of units has a shared resource pool.

## Individual Unit Resource Pool
Each individual unit has a resource pool.

## Positive Affirmation / Mental Health Support Button
UI tool to share a message of affirmation.

## Automatic Refuelling

## Control Remapping
All (or a large percentage of) controls may be remapped to player-specified alternatives

## StockPile Economy
Economy is based around having a exact certain amount of a given resource before doing a thing.

## Research
Spending time/resource to unlock new things.

## Tech Tree Research
Players can spend time/resources to unlock things on a tech tree.

## Building-based Research
Unlocking new things is based around having some prerequisite building/unit.

## Intel
Information about the world.

## Active Intel (Scouting)
Taking an action to gain intel by specifically gaining it (e.g. scout plane)

## Passive Intel
Intel is gained passively by something without direct player action causing it at that time (e.g. RADAR tower)

## RADAR
A sensor which detects units within a certain distance. May be affected by terrain line of sight.

## Map Fog Of War
Until you have seen an area of the map you do not know anything about it (including the terrain).

## Intel Fog of War
There are areas of the map where you have no intel about enemy units.

## Overworld Map
A separate map that shows the world at a very large scale.

## Strategic Zoom
Can zoom out to view the entire map, if zoomed out enough.

## FFA (Free for all)
There are no fixed teams; everyone is, as far as the game is concerned, not on the same team.

## Battle Royale
Only one player ultimately wins (i.e. no shared victory amongst alliance members).

## Alliances
Players can enter an agreement to share certain resources (e.g. units/vision and not shoot one another).

## Fixed Factions
There are a certain number of fixed teams which players can choose to join.

## Fixed Teams
Teams are decided at the start and are immutable during the game

## Concurrent Alliances
A player can be in multiple simultaneous teams/factions/groups.

## Units are a squad
Units are spawned and controlled as squad. 

## Reinforcing Squad Units
Squad size can be increased by reinforcements from a factory.

## Health Pool determines effectiveness
